If you're looking for ways to make money online but don't know where to start? I was in the same boat until I decided to take action and try blogging for 30 days. <br><br>Surprisingly, I managed to earn $90 within that timeframe, and today I'll walk you through exactly how I did it.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Research and Preparation</h3>
<p class="para">
    The first thing I did was research and select 30+ low competition keywords based on my desired niche. This helped me target specific topics that had the potential to attract traffic without facing too much competition. <br><br>Additionally, I purchased a cheap domain name from Hostinger for $0.99 and a hosting plan from Namecheap for $23 per year. Connecting everything was seamless, and I was ready to move on to the next step.
</p>


<h3>Step 2: Setting Up the Website</h3>
<p class="para">
    Once my domain and hosting were in place, I logged into my WordPress dashboard and installed necessary themes and plugins. <br><br>I spent time customizing the design, fonts, and typography to ensure a visually appealing website. <br><br>Remarkably, I managed to finish everything in just one day, setting a solid foundation for my blogging journey.
</p>


<h3>Step 3: Creating Content</h3>

<p class="para">
    With the design part out of the way, I dove into creating content. <br><br>Over the next few weeks, I wrote 70 blog posts focusing on various ways to generate passive income, including affiliate marketing, blogging, dropshipping, and selling digital products. <br><br>Each post was meticulously crafted to provide value and resonate with my target audience.
</p>

<h3>Step 4: Driving Traffic</h3>

<p class="para">After publishing my blog posts, it was time to attract visitors to my website. I worked on search engine optimization (SEO) to improve my site's visibility on Google and other search engines. <br><br>Additionally, I set up social media channels and started promoting my content to reach a wider audience.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Monetization</h3>

<p class="para">To monetize my blog, I implemented multiple income streams. <br><br>I signed up for display ads to generate passive income from ad clicks. <br><br>I also promoted affiliate products related to my niche and earned commissions for every sale made through my referral links. <br>Additionally, I created and sold my own digital products, such as PDF guides, which proved to be a lucrative source of income.
</p>

<h3>Step 6: Results</h3>

<p class="para">
    Within the 30-day timeframe, I received my first online sales through selling my own products (PDF guides). <br><br>This was a significant milestone for me and served as validation that my efforts were paying off. <br><br>It goes to show that with dedication and persistence, anyone can achieve success in the world of online business.
</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p class="para">
    My 30-day blogging experiment was a resounding success, and I'm excited to continue growing my online business. <br><br>If you're interested in starting your own journey to earning money online, <br>I encourage you to read my full guide on starting a blog from scratch. <br><br>With the right strategy and mindset, you too can achieve financial freedom and create a life of abundance.
